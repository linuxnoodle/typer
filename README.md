## Typer
A really bad typing practice program.
## Requirements
- make
- UNIX based system
## Installation
```git clone https://github.com/linuxnoodle/typer && cd typer && make```
or go to [here](https://github.com/linuxnoodle/typer/releases).
## TODO
- Add colors to windows builds.
- Rework typing system, as having it based on the entire phrase makes typing error prone.
- Add system to hold average WPM, and the most missed characters.
